        "Machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly popular, powerful and accurate. However, these models are often \"black boxes\". It is often difficult to know how these models arrived at a prediction. Several techniques exist to explain the prediction of machine learning models. One popular technique, which will be used in this project, is SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. SHAP values measure how much each feature (such as income, age, ...) contributes to the model's prediction. SHAP values can help identify the most important features for the model and how they affect the outcome. This method comes from cooperative game theory."
